INTRODUCTION

............

Here you can find a set of data structures and algorithm useful for general purpose.
Currently you can find:
- linked list: a simple data structure containing a set of nodes linked one by one with two pointer (next and prev);
- stack: an implementation of stack ADT by using an array as container;
- queue: an implementation of queue ADT by using an array as container;
- sorting algorithms.
Should be useful use this data structures for your project.
Also, you can find sorting algorithm: currently there are just buble sort and selection sort.
The method is generic: you can use a compare function to state the sorting kind (ascending or descending).

HOW TO USE

...........

You just need to include the files in your project and compile it normally.
Use the initialize() and crea() functions to create the data structures or your code does not work.
Remember to include <stdlib.h> and <stdio.h> in your code.
